## [Emotional Pizzeria]  
**Core Concept**: A “papa’s pizzeria” style game which involves the player having to serve customers the right order within a specific time limit. Instead of the traditional game where customers order food, the customers will tell the player about a situation they experienced, and the player will have to decide which emotion is closest to what they must be feeling. If they get it correct, they receive a certain number of hearts.

**Genre:** Children’s game, restaurant management game 

**Target Audience:** The game will be designed for a diverse audience that includes neurotypical and autistic individuals.

**Unique Selling Points (USPs)**: Restaurant concept, emotional granularity, levels of increasing difficulty.
